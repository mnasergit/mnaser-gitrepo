Seerah of Prophet Muhammed (PBUH) # Part-1
==========================================

Specialties of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH)
--------------------------------------

Insha'Allah, before we learn about the Prophet's life (seerah), let's understand why he's special.

To begin, we must know that Allah chose Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) above all others. Allah said, "We have raised up your remembrance and mention," showing how important he is. Whenever we talk about Allah, we also talk about Prophet Muhammad. Allah even called him "rahma-tul-lilalameen," meaning he embodies mercy. The Prophet's coming itself is an act of mercy, and his whole message is about kindness and compassion.

Now, let's talk about the names of the Prophet (PBUH). He had many names, but the most known two names Muhammad and Ahmad come from "hameda," meaning to praise. This is not just any praise; it's the highest level of praise, recognizing his worth. Muhammad and Ahmad symbolize the highest quality and quantity of praise, respectively.

In a detailed story, it's explained that on Judgment Day, people will realize the truth of Islam, but it will be too late to believe. They will ask previous prophets for help, but each will worry about their own actions. Finally, they'll ask Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) to intercede, starting the Day of Judgment. All of humanity will praise him, earning him the "al makaam al mahmood" – the highest praise.

The Prophet (PBUH) signals the Day of Judgment; his coming is the main sign. He is known as Al-Aaqib, the last prophet, and Nabi-u-Rahma, the prophet of forgiveness. His unique qualities include being the final prophet for all humanity, including the jinn. He leads the largest community of believers, was given the most powerful miracle (the Quran), and had a miraculous night journey to the heavens. Essentially, Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) holds a special place in Islam because of his exceptional qualities that set him apart.

The Prophet (PBUH) is praised by everyone – Allah, the angels, all the prophets, and every person. Muslims and non-Muslims admire his character and qualities, and everything in creation praises him. Throughout history and into the future, no human is praised more than Prophet Muhammad (PBUH).

In summary, let's talk about some unique qualities the Prophet (PBUH) had:
1. He is the final prophet chosen by Allah.
2. His prophethood was decided even before Adam existed.
3. He was sent for all of humanity, including the jinn.
4. Allah helped him with a special kind of fear against his enemies.
5. He has the largest and most powerful community of believers.
