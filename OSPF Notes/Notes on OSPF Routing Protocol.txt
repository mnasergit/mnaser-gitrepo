=================================================


OSPF Characteristics
--------------------
● Link-state Routing Protocol
  > Link: Interface of the router
  > State: Description of the interface
  > Can see full topology within area
● Uses Dijktra’s Shortest Path First (SPF) algorithm
● Classless
  > Supports VLSM
● Efficient / Scalable / Secure / Fast convergence
● Supports Multi Area
● IP Protocol number 89

Link State Routing Process
--------------------------
● Router learns own directly connected networks
● Discovers neighbor
● Builds LSA
● Floods LSA and stores incoming LSAs in LSDB
● Runs SPF to build loop-free SPT

Basic Configuration
-------------------
● Network statement​
  > Enable interfaces in OSPF process that falls within the range​
  > Sends Hello via OSPF enabled interfaces​
  > Advertises networks that falls within the range​

​# conf t​
   router ospf 1​
    network 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 area 0​

● Interface Specific Configuration​
  > Enable interface in OSPF process​
  > Sends Hello via that interface​
  > Advertises network​

# conf t​
   interface gi0/0​
    ip ospf 1 area 0​

​# show ip ospf neighbor​
# show ip protocols​

What’s inside a Hello​
---------------------
● Router ID **​
● Hello interval and Dead interval *​
● Active neighbors (if any)​
● Area ID *​
● IP addresses of DR and BDR (for broadcast link)​
● Subnet Mask *​
● Authentication parameters *​
● Interface Priority​
● Stub Area Flags *​

OSPF States​
-----------
● Down​
  > No Hello detected​
● Attempt​
  > For NBMA (static neighbor)​
● Init​
  > Router receives a Hello​
● 2-Way​
  > Router sees itself as a neighbor in a received Hello​
● DR/BDR Election (for broadcast link)​
● Exstart​
  > Master/Slave election​
  > Router having highest numerical RID will be the master​
● Exchange​
  > Master sends the DBD first; then by Slave​
  > DBD contains summary of the LSDB​
  > IP MTU of interfaces should be identical (overridable)​
● Loading​
  > Send LSAck for DBD​
  > Compare information on DBD with LSDB​
  > Send LSR for additional info​
  > LSU is in response of LSR​
  > LSU contains LSAs​
● Full​
  > Sends LSAck for LSR​
  > LSBDs are synched​

DR/BDR Election​
---------------
● DR is essential in multi-access (broadcast) links​
● Eliminates the need of full-mesh adjacency​
  > n(n-1)/2​
● Reduces LSA flooding impact​
● Requires a BDR for fail-over​
● Election criteria​
  > Highest interface priority​
  > Highest RID​
● Priority ranges from 0 to 255​
  > 255 for DR (Hub router)​
  > 254 for BDR (Hub router)​
  > 0 for DROther (Spoke routers)​
    - Doesn’t contest in election​
  > 1 is set by default​
● First router will wait 40s to declare itself as DR​
  > Wait timer is 40s (by default)​
● States:​
  > DR to BDR: Full​
  > DROther to DR: Full​
  > DROther to BDR: Full​
  > DROther to DROther: 2-Way​
● DR and BDR receive LSAs from all DROthers​
  > Only DR floods LSAs to all DROther​
● DR/BDR is for per multi-access link; not per area​
● When DR returns it can’t take over the role​
  > Non preemptive​
● Interface type P2P avoids DR/BDR election​
  > Eliminates Type 2 LSA flooding​
  > Keeps LSDB smaller​
● In case of interface type mismatch:​
  > Routers will form adjacency​
  > Routers will exchange LSAs​
  > But routers will exclude the link from SPF calculation​

Network Link​ Types
------------------
● Transit​
  > A link that carries neighborship or adjacency (on broadcast links)​
  > Represented by the IP of DR​
● Point-to-Point​
  > A link that carries adjacency (on P2P links)​
  > P2P type creates two links:​
    1. A link that identifies neighbor RID for that segment​
    2. A stub network with subnet mask to advertise that network​
  > Represented by neighbor’s RID​
● Stub​
  > A link that doesn’t carry any neighborship or adjacency​
  > Usually, a LAN facing interface​
  > A “secondary” network is always a stub network and never forms neighborship​
  > Represented by IP network​
● Virtual Link​
  > Represented by neighbor’s RID​

OSPF Packet Types
-----------------
● Hello​
  > For neighbor discovery​
● DBD​
  > Contains summary of LSDB​
● LSR​
  > To request for additional info​
● LSU​
  > Contains LSAs​
● LSAck​
  > OSPF uses RTP for reliability​

Multicast in OSPF​
-----------------
● All OSPF router send Hello using:​
  > IP: 224.0.0.5​
  > MAC: 01:00:5e:00:00:05​
● All DROther send LSA using:​
  > IP: 224.0.0.6​
  > MAC: 01:00:5e:00:00:05​

Administrative Distance​
-----------------------
● Defines the preference of OSPF over other protocols​
● Default AD value is 110​
● Must be identical on all routers​
  > To avoid loops or sub-optimal routing​
● A golden Rule: Longest Prefix Match > AD > Metric​

OSPF Router ID​
--------------
● Router ID is the identifier of an OSPF router​
  > Must be unique in an area​
  > Should be unique network wide​
● A 32-bit integer value​
  > Looks like an IPv4 address; but not an IPv4 address actually​
● Selection criteria:​
  > Configured manually (should be a best practice)​
  > Highest IPv4 address of loopback interface​
  > Highest IPv4 address of physical interface​

OSPF Timers​
-----------
● Hello timer​
  > 10s for broadcast and p2p interfaces (by default)​
● Dead timer​
  > 40s; 4 times of Hello (by default)​

# conf t​
   int face gi0/0​
    ip ospf hello-interval 3 //also sets Dead to 12s (4 times) automatically​
    ip ospf dead-interval 12​

​   ip ospf dead-interval minimal hello-multiplier 3​
   //sets Dead to 1s; and Hello to 333ms (1/3 of Dead)​

● Hello and Dead intervals must be identical at both end​
● BFD can be deployed for quicker link failure detection​
● Wait timer​
  > A time to wait for first router to declare itself as DR​
● Retransmit timer​

OSPF Metric​​
-----------
● Cost is the metric in OSPF​
● Cost = Reference BW / Interface BW​
  > Ref BW = 100 Mb (by default)​
● For Fast Ethernet link:​
  > Cost = 100 Mb / 100 Mb = 1​
● For Gigabit Ethernet link:​
  > Cost = 100 Mb / 1000 Mb = 1
    - Fractional value isn’t supported

# conf t​
   router ospf 1​
    auto-cost reference-bandwidth 1000​

   interface gi0/0​
    bandwidth 64 //in Kbps​

  > Cost = 100000000 / 64000 = 1562​

● Reference BW should be identical on all routers​
  > To avoid sub optimal routing​
● Cost can be configured straight forward​

# conf t​
   interface gi0/0​
    ip ospf cost 10​

OSPF Maximum Path​
-----------------
● OSPF supports multiple equal cost path (if any)​
  > 4 equal cost path (by default in Cisco)​
  > Can be configured up to 32 path (depending on platform)​
​
# conf t​
   router ospf 1​
    maximum-path 6​

Shutting Down OSPF​
------------------
● In case of:​
  > Troubleshooting​
  > Network migration​
​
# conf t​
   router ospf 1​
    shutdown​

Passive Interface​
-----------------
● Restricts Hello to be sent via an interface​
● All the LAN facing interfaces should be passive​
● Secure network preventing unwanted neighbors and routes​
● Saves network bandwidth​ and processing

# conf t​
   router ospf 1​
    passive-interface default​
    no passive-interface gi0/0​

Authentication​
--------------
● To prevent any unwanted neighborship​
● OSPF supports:​
  > Plain Text​
  > MD5​
  > HMAC-SHA (from IOS 15.4(1)T)​

● Plain Text​
# conf t​
   interface gi0/0​
    ip ospf authentication-key OSPF1234​
    ip ospf authentication //for interface level​

   router ospf 1​
    area 0 authentication //for area level​

  > Key string must be identical​

● MD5
# conf t​
   interface gi0/0​
    ip ospf message-digest-key 1 md5 OSPF1234​
    ip ospf authentication message-digest //for interface level​

   router ospf 1​
    area 0 authentication message-digest //for area level​
​
  > Key number and key string must be identical​

● HMAC-SHA​
# conf t​
   key-chain MYCHAIN​
    key 1​
     cryptographic-algorithm hmac-sha-512​
      key-string OSPF1234​
​
   interface gi0/0​
    ip ospf authentication key-chain MYCHAIN //for interface level​

  > Key number and key string must be identical​

# debug ip ospf packet​
  > Auth 0: No authentication​
  > Auth 1: Plain text authentication​
  > Auth 2: MD5 Authentication​

TTL Security Check​
------------------
● Protects OSPF control plain from remote attack​
● When enabled:​
  > Router will send OSPF packet with TTL 255​
  > Router will receive OSPF packet only if TTL is 255 in received packet​
● Only packets from directly connected router will be accepted​
● Default TTL value for OSPF packet is 1​

# conf t​
   router ospf 1​
    ttl-security all-interfaces ​

# conf t​
   router ospf 1​
    ttl-security all-interfaces //accepts packet with TTL 255​
    ttl-security all-interfaces //accepts packet with TTL from 155 to 255​
​
   interface gi0/0​
    ip ospf ttl-security​

● Not applied to virtual links or sham links (by default)​
# area virtual-link ttl-security​
# area sham-link ttl-security ​

Route Redistribution​
--------------------
● Different protocols don’t share routing information with each other​
● Redistribution between protocols is required​
  > Connected and static routes can also be redistributed​
● Redistribution happens outbound​
● Redistribution should be mutual​
● Should be configured carefully​
  > To prevent routing table flapping or loop​
● Different protocol’s metric are not compatible with each other​
  > RIP: Hop count​
  > EIGRP: K Value​
  > OSPF/IS-IS: Cost​
  > BGP: Multiple attributes​
● Seed metric is required to be configured​
● For multipoint redistribution route tagging to be configure​
  > To prevent routing loop​
  > Protocol A --> Protocol B -->X Protocol A​
        Set tag 1234   Match tag 1234 (deny)​

Route Redistribution​ in OSPF
----------------------------
● OSPF has two types of External route​
  > External Type 1​
  > External Type 2 (by default)​
● Seed metric (by default):​
  > From BGP: 1​
  > From other protocols: 20​
● For External Type 2:​
  > Cost is always 20 (except from BGP)​
  > Forward metric to ASBR works in background​
● For External Type 1:​
  > Cost = 20 + Forward metric​

# conf t​
   router ospf 1​
    redistribute static subnets metric-type 1 metric 5​
    /​
    redistribute connected subnets ​
    /​
    redistribute bgp 100 subnets route-map RM-MAP​
    /​
    default-information originate always​

● External routes are redistributed using Type 5 LSA​
● ASBR’s RID is propagated by ABR using Type 4 LSA​
● Selection of External routes​
  > Lowest Seed Metric sent by ASBR​
  > Lowest path cost towards ASBR (Forwarding Metric)​
  > Highest RID of ASBR​
● Redistributing BGP into OSPF results in loss of BGP attributes ​
● Shouldn’t redistribute full internet routing table from BGP​

Multi Area OSPF
---------------
Key Terms​
● Backbone Area​
● Non-backbone Area​
● Backbone Router​
● Non-backbone Router​
● Area Border Router (ABR)​
● Autonomous System Border Router (ASBR)​
  > At least one interface should be Area 0; Loopback also works​
● Helps to reduce the size of LSDB​
● Less SPF calculation inside an area​
  > SFP is performed independently for each area​
● Router in an area has no visibility of other area​
  > Between areas no topology information is shared​
● Reduces the LSA update size to keep under interface MTU​
  > Fragmentation causes a big problem​
● Number of ABR is an area should be limited​
  > ABR keeps LSDB of multiple area (including Area 0)​
● All areas need to connect to Backbone Area​
  > Area 0.0.0.0, has the transit capability​
  > Prevents Loop​
  > Virtual Links for exceptional case​
● Two levels of hierarchy:​
  > Backbone Area​
  > Non-Backbone Area​

Link State Advertisement (LSA)
------------------------------
● Link State Advertisement​
  > Not a packet but a data structure​
  > A piece of puzzle of the LSBD​
  > Travels inside a LSU​
● A LSA may contain multiple link information​
  > Maintains Sequence Number​
    - A 32-bit number for version controlling​
● LSA is periodically advertised in every 30 min (by default)​
  > To keep the LSDB synchronized and identical​
  > Adds random delay (based on when the LSA was created) to prevent big event​
● Receiving router floods LSA is updated info inside​
● In OSPF there are 11 LSAs​
  > Whereas in IS-IS there are only 2 Levels​
● Why lot of LSAs in OSPF?​
  > Answer: Critical design requirements and Scalability (not Simplicity)​

Link State Database (LSDB)
--------------------------
● The core of OSPF protocol​
● LSDB fields are:​
  > Link ID: Identifies the object​
  > Adv Router: Router ID of LSA originator​
  > AGE: Age of the LSA on which router the command is executed​
  > Seq#: The sequence number to protect out-of-order LSA​
  > Checksum: To verify integrity of LSA during flooding​
  > Link Count: Number of links of router in Type 1 LSA​
● Flooding LSAs and building LSBDs are not enough for routing table​
● Routing and Forwarding table require an additional SFP calculation​

OSPF LSA Types
--------------
● Type 1: Router LSA​
  > Router generates a single LSA containing multiple link​
  > Floods within the area​
● Type 2: Network LSA​
  > Handles DR/BDR stuffs in broadcast links​
  > Can be omitted in P2P links​
    - DR/BDR election can prolong convergence time​
  > Floods within area​
● Type 3: Summary Net Link LSA​
  > Contains multi area information​
  > ABR re-originates LSA; acts as the Adv Router​
    - ABR converts Type1 to Type 3​
  > Not summarized by default​
    - Propagates other areas link failure ​
    - Need to manually summarized by the ABR​
    - IP addressing plan should be contiguous​
  > Adds Null0 summary route to prevent forwarding loop​
● Type 4: ASBR Summary LSA​
  > ABR of originating area propagates ASBR’s RID to other areas​
● Type 5: External LSA​
  > Contains external routes outside of OSPF domain​
    - Redistributed from other protocols, connected, static, default-origination​
  > Generated by ASBR​
  > Floods throughout entire OSPF domain except STUB areas​
  > Routes can be summarized by ASBR​
  > Adds Null0 summary route​
● Type 7: NSSA LSA ​
  > Contains external routes outside of OSPF domain​
    - Type 5 is not permitted in STUB areas​
  > Generated by ASBR in NSSA area​
  > Floods within NSSA area​
  > ABR in NSSA area converts it from Type 7 to Type 5​
    - No Type 4 LSA for ASBR’s information ​

OSPF Special Area​s
------------------
● Keeps LSA flooding minimum; Keeps LSDB smaller​
● Less SPF calculation; Smaller Routing table​
● Provides fault isolation​
  > Can be useful for critical enterprise network design​
  > Not suitable for service provider networks​
● Types:​
  > Stub Area​
  > Totally Stub Area (T. Stub)​
  > Not So Stubby Area (NSSA)​
  > Totally Not So Stubby Area (T.NSSA)​

Stub Area​
---------
● “IA” route sent by ABR​
● Additional default route sent by ABR (as Type 3)​
● No “External” route via backbone area ​
  > No Type 4 LSA​
  > No Type 5 LSA​
● No ASBR is allowed​

T.Stub Area​
-----------
● No “IA” route sent by ABR​
● Only default route sent by ABR (as Type 3)​
● No “External” route via backbone area ​
  > No Type 4 LSA​
  > No Type 5 LSA​
● No ASBR is allowed​

NSSA
----
● “IA” route sent by ABR​
● Additional default route sent by ABR (as Type 3)​
● No “External” route​
  > No Type 4 LSA​
  > No Type 5 LSA​
● ASBR is allowed​
  > Introduces Type 7 LSA​
  > Floods within NSSA area​
  > Propagated by ABR to other areas as Type 5 (But No Type 4 for ASBR info)​

T.NSSA​
------
● No “IA” route sent by ABR ​
● Only default route sent by ABR (as N2 by default)​
● No “External” route​
  > No Type 4 LSA​
  > No Type 5 LSA​
● ASBR is allowed​
  > Introduces Type 7 LSA​
  > Floods within NSSA area​
  > Propagated by ABR to other areas as Type 5 (But No Type 4 for ASBR info)​

● LSA Flooding Scope​

LSA    Normal    Stub    T.Stub    NSSA    T.NSSA
1        Y         Y        Y        Y        Y 
2        Y         Y        Y        Y        Y 
3        Y         Y*       N*       Y*       N* 
4        Y         N        N        N        N 
5        Y         N        N        N        N 
7        N         N        N        Y        Y 

* Indicates the "Default Route"

Virtual Link​
------------
● A way to connect an isolated area to the backbone area​
● Adds complexity and should not be a good practice​
● Need to configure between ABR 1 (that connects Area0) and ABR 2 connecting isolated area​
  > Uses RID of ABR1 and ABR2; not their IP addresses​
● ABR2 stores full LSDB of Area 0​
  > ABR2 send Type 3 routes to downstream routers​
  > ABR2 may summarize the Type 3 routes​
● DNA = Do not Advertise​

OSPF Route Types
----------------
● Intra Area “O”​
● Inter Area “O IA”​
● External ​
  > Type 1 “E1”​
  > Type 2 “E2”​
● NSSA External​
  > Type 1 “N1”​
  > Type 2 “N2”​

● O > O IA > N1 > E1 > N2 > E2 (from IOS 15.1(2)S; RFC 3101)​
  1. Intra Area Route “O”​
  2. Inter Area Route “O IA”​
  3. NSSA Type 1 Route “N1”​
  4. External Type 1 Route “E1”​
  5. NSSA Type 2 Route “N2”​
  6. External Type 2 Route “E2”​

● O > O IA > E1 > N1 > E2 > N2 (on older IOS; RFC1587)​

Route Summarization​
-------------------
● Summarization must be done on ASBRs and ABRs​
  > Summary route needs at least one contributing route​
  > The cost of the summary route is derived from the lowest cost of a contributing route​
  > Summarization should be done to all neighbors​
● Advantages:​
  > Saves CPU, Memory and BW​
  > Hides smaller prefixes​
  > Helps to keep routing stable​
  > Helps to run SPF faster​
● Disadvantages:​
  > Forwards traffic to unused network​
  > Improper configuration may cause suboptimal routing​
  > Destroys MPLS LSP​

Route Filtering​
---------------
● Filtering must be done on ASBRs and ABRs​
  > ASBR can filter Type 5 LSA​
  > ABR can filter Type 3 LSA​
● Shouldn’t be configured to filter Type 1 LSA​
  > OSPF can’t filter Type 1 LSA​
  > Local filtering can be configured on any edge node of an area​
  > Shouldn’t be configured on any intermediary node of an area​
  > Causes traffic blackholing​

Prefix Suppression​
------------------
● P2P links aren’t useful for traffic delivery​
  > Loopbacks can be used for iBGP​
● Excludes “STUB Links” in SPF calculation​
  > P2P means the Transit links​
  > Suppresses “STUB Links of P2P links only” from Type 1 LSA​
● Reduces LSDB size​
  > Helps to run SPF faster​
● Keeps routing table stable​
  > Less SPF run​
  > Smaller routing table​

OSPF Convergence​
----------------
● Link/Node failure causes:​
  > Failure detection  BFD​
  > Failure propagation  Reduced LSA throttling timer​
  > Processing new information  SPF Calculation​
  > Updating RT and FT  depends on HW capacity; can not be tuned​
● Convergence is control plane event​
● Convergence is reactive​

OSPF Fast Re-route​ (FRR)
------------------------
● FRR (or Protection) is a data plane event​
● Protection is a hot-standby as soon as failure is detected​
● Post convergence path can be calculated before failure occurs​
  > Path must be loop free; but always can not be achieved with LFA, rLFA​
  > LFA and rLFA require LDP signaling even in non MPLS network​
  > TI-LFA in SR is the latest solution; 50ms​
● FRR is proactive (whereas convergence is reactive)​

Microloop in OSPF​
-----------------
● Microloop is a long-lasting problem in IGP​
● Microloop may happen in FRR​
● May cause traffic drop during convergence time​
● SR can solve the problem using TI-LFA​

OSPF Multi Area Adjacency
-------------------------
● A feature to form multiple adjacency over a single link​
  > One adjacency for Area 0​
  > Another adjacency for Area n​
● Useful to prevent sub-optimal traffic forwarding between areas​

OSPF Deployment Consideration​
-----------------------------
* For Service Provider​ *
● Suitable for deploying RSVP TE and SR​
  > Capabilities have been extended​
● Can be used in IP core​
  > Multi domain IGP is a good choice for Seamless/Unified MPLS​
● Can be used as PE-CE protocol in L3VPN​
  > Should never be used to push route in global table​
● If not necessary don’t use multi area OSPF​
  > To keep design simple; multi domain OSPF is a good option​
  > RSVP-TE is very hard to deploy​

* For Enterprise​ *
● Suitable for deploying in typical 3-tier design​
  > Between Core and Aggregation​
  > Host gateways are in Aggregation nodes​
● Multi area is a good consideration for large network​
● Can be run over tunnels​
  > To connect multiple location over ISP network​
  > GRE, mGRE, DMVPN, etc​

* For Data Center​ *
● DC now a days uses Spine and Leaf topology​
● OSPF can be used as underlying protocol for VXLAN VTEPs​
  > But IS-IS seems more popular for this​
● Multiple DC location meshed can cause more LSA flooding​
  > eBGP is getting popularity day by day​
