OSPF Characteristics
--------------------
● Link-state Routing Protocol
> Link: Interface of the router
> State: Description of the interface
> Can see full topology within area
● Uses Dijktra’s Shortest Path First (SPF) algorithm
● Classless
> Supports VLSM
● Efficient / Scalable / Secure / Fast convergence
● Supports Multi Area
● IP Protocol number 89

Link State Routing Process
--------------------------
● Router learns own directly connected networks
● Discovers neighbor
● Builds LSA
● Floods LSA and stores incoming LSAs in LSDB
● Runs SPF to build loop-free SPT
